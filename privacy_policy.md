## User Data Management & Third-Party Services

---

As **Coral Bloom!** does not feature its own in-game account creation, any personal data associated with your gameplay, such as achievements or leaderboard scores, is handled directly by **Google Play Game Services** and is tied to your Google Play Games profile.

- **Your Google Play Games Profile:** You can manage and delete data associated with your Google Play Games profile directly through the Google Play Games app or your Google Account settings. This typically includes:
    - Deleting Play Games data for a specific game.
    - Deleting your entire Play Games profile and all associated data.
- **Developer-Managed Data and Third-Party SDKs:** While we do not create or manage user accounts, we utilize third-party SDKs (such as Unity Analytics, AppsFlyer, and Unity Cloud Diagnostics) which may collect various types of data (e.g., Device ID, IP address, usage data, crash logs, attribution data). This data is typically used for analytics, ad attribution, and game improvement.
    - **Data Deletion Requests for Third-Party Data:** Many of these third-party services offer mechanisms for data deletion requests at the user level, though these are typically handled by the respective service provider. If you have concerns about specific data we may hold or process via these third-party SDKs (e.g., related to your Device ID for ad targeting or analytics), please contact us using the information below. We will then work with the relevant third-party providers to facilitate your request where possible and as required by law.
- **How to Manage Your Google Play Games Data:** For information on how to manage or delete your Google Play Games profile and associated data, please refer to Google's official support pages, such as:
    - **Google Play Help - Delete your Play Games profile and data**: https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/9130646
- **Opt-Out for Analytics/Advertising:** For data collected by analytics and advertising attribution partners, your device's operating system (iOS or Android) typically provides settings that allow you to limit ad tracking or reset your advertising identifier. Utilizing these features can impact the data collected by services like AppsFlyer for personalized advertising. For Unity Analytics, some data collected may be tied to in-game identifiers; please refer to Unity's privacy policy for their specific opt-out mechanisms.
